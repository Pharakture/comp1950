					<h3>Europe vacation</h3>
					<p>Since I'm considered a full-time student I don't get to go on many vacations with my family because of school semesters. I'm usually the one house-sitting while my parents and my brother go galavanting off into the distance but last year I took Summer semester off to go on a month-long trip to Europe with my family. My parents had booked a cruise that took us from Rome to different areas in the Mediterranean so to make it a big vacation we added 2-3 more weeks of sight seeing on our itinerary.</p>

					<h3>Paris, France</h3>
					<p>Our first stop in our trip was lovely Paris! We visited sites like the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower. We went around early May so it was slightly overcast during our stay but the temperatures were still warm and kind of humid compared to Vancouver. </p>

					<p>The Louvre was amazing and I wish we spent more time there. If you decide to go make sure to wear some comfy shoes, eat before hand (the cafe inside is pricey) and spend at least a day there. There are lots of wings to visit if you're into history and art.</p>

					<p>As for the Eiffel Tower it was gorgeous up top. At the base there are a lot of street vendors and peddlers selling trinkets so mind your bag and pockets. Once you pay for your admission there's a little elevator that takes you up to the tower to the observation deck. There's a little shop that sells champagne if you feel like celebrating!</p>

					<h3>Rome, Italty</h3>
					<p>Our main stop in our trip was Rome. Rome was a sight to behold. The streets were lined with people and there were so many attractions and places to sight-see that we were outside walking around every day. We used the Metro, their train system, to get around Rome as best as we could. The most notable places we visited was the Colosseum and the Trevi Fountain. But we also went to numerous churches to admire the artwork.</p>

					<p>We paid for a tour of the Colosseum, we managed to slot ourselves into a tour that was going to start in 10 minutes so we scrambled to the meeting area to find our tour guide. To our luck, we were the only ones to sign up for the tour so it was like a personalized tour around the Colosseum. If you get the opportunity to go it is best to go in the morning and go up to the kiosk to book a tour guide as soon as you can. Some tour guides don't have microphones so if the group is too large you won't be able to hear them talk.</p>

					<p> As for the Trevi Fountain, it's much prettier at night because lights are installed to make the statues look really pretty. There are lots of people at night too but generally people take turns going up to the edge of the fountain to take pictures, toss in a coin, and shuffle away for the next party to take pictures.</p>

					<h3>Barcelona, Spain</h3>
					<p>One of our last stops in the trip was Barcelona. We were on a cruise at the time and this was one of the day stops. Our main stop was Sagrada Familia. A church that is still undergoing construction to this day -- in fact I don't think it's planned to be completed until sometime during the 2020's. Unfortunately, we never made it inside, turns out you had to book a time to enter the church. But we did manage to take some photos outside and ademire the stunning architecture. </p>

				<h3>New HTML 5 Content</h3>
				<aside>
					<h4>Setting Viewport</h4>
					<p>I thought this was interesting but there's a new meta tag which gives the browser instructions on the page dimensions and scaling which will depend whether the user opened your webpage on their computer, tablet, or a mobile device.</p>

					<h5>Tag Attributes</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="code">name="viewport" </span>: what the user can see in the webpage</li>
						<li><span class="code">content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</span>: sets the page width to the device width and the scale is whether you want the user zoomed in or not</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Browser Compatibility</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>IE11: partial support</li>
						<li>Edge: partial support</li>
						<li>Firefox: supported</li>
						<li>Chrome: supported</li>
						<li>Safari: supported</li>
						<li>Opera: supported</li>
					</ul>
				</aside>

				<aside>
					<h4>Progress Bar</h4>
					<p>This is sooo cool. I think adding a progress bar feature is a great idea for fund-type websites because visual representations are easier for people to understand. You can also style it using CSS.</p>

					<h5>Tag Attributes</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="code">max="2"</span>: a number which represents the total amount of work</li>
						<li><span class="code">value="1"</span>: a number which represents the how much of the task is complete</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Browser Compatibility</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>IE11: supported</li>
						<li>Edge: supported</li>
						<li>Firefox: supported</li>
						<li>Chrome: supported</li>
						<li>Safari: supported, partial on iOS</li>
						<li>Opera: supported</li>
					</ul>

					<span>Testing out the progress bar tag.</span>
